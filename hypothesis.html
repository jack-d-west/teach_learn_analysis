    <h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
    <p>Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used in data analytics to determine the validity of an assumption (the hypothesis) about a population based on sample data. It helps analysts make inferences and assess relationships, ultimately guiding data-driven decisions.</p>
    <p>There are typically five steps in hypothesis testing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Formulating the null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
        <li>Choosing a significance level (Î±).</li>
        <li>Calculating a test statistic based on sample data.</li>
        <li>Determining the p-value or critical value to compare against the test statistic.</li>
        <li>Drawing a conclusion: reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Understanding hypothesis testing is crucial for evaluating relationships in data and validating models in analytics. This topic is divided into sessions covering different hypothesis testing methods and approaches.</p>
