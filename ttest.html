    <h2>T-Test</h2>
    <p>The <strong>t-test</strong> is a statistical test used to compare the means of two groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other. It’s especially useful when dealing with small sample sizes or unknown population variances.</p>

    <h3>Types of T-tests:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>One-sample t-test</strong>: Compares the mean of a single group to a known value (e.g., population mean).</li>
        <li><strong>Independent two-sample t-test</strong>: Compares the means of two independent groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Paired t-test</strong>: Compares means from the same group at different times (e.g., before and after treatment).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Use a T-Test?</h3>
    <p>T-tests allow us to make data-driven conclusions about group differences. In our example, it helped the teacher assess whether the new teaching method led to better student performance.</p>

    <h2>T-Tests and Examples</h2>

    <h3>1. One-Sample T-Test</h3>
    <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: A nutritionist believes that the average sodium content in a particular brand of soup should be 500 mg. To test this claim, she collects a sample of 8 cans and finds their sodium content as follows (in mg): 520, 505, 495, 510, 515, 490, 480, 500.</p>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Formulate Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Null Hypothesis (H₀)</em>: The mean sodium content is 500 mg.</li>
                <li><em>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)</em>: The mean sodium content is not 500 mg.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate the Sample Mean and Standard Deviation</strong>.
            <p>Sample Mean ≈ 501.25 mg</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Run the One-Sample T-Test</strong> to compute the <em>t-value</em> and <em>p-value</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpret the Result</strong>: If the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting the actual mean sodium content differs from 500 mg.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Independent Two-Sample T-Test</h3>
    <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: A psychologist wants to see if caffeine affects memory recall. They conduct a study where 15 participants receive caffeine, and another 15 receive a placebo. After an hour, all participants take a memory test. Their scores are then compared between the two groups.</p>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Formulate Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Null Hypothesis (H₀)</em>: There is no difference in memory recall scores between the caffeine and placebo groups.</li>
                <li><em>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)</em>: There is a difference in memory recall scores between the caffeine and placebo groups.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate the Means and Standard Deviations for Each Group</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Run the Independent Two-Sample T-Test</strong> to compute the <em>t-value</em> and <em>p-value</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpret the Result</strong>: If the p-value is less than 0.05, we conclude caffeine has a measurable effect on recall.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. Paired T-Test</h3>
    <p><strong>Scenario</strong>: A company introduces a training program to improve typing speed. Ten employees take a typing test before the training and another test afterward. The company wants to determine if the program led to a significant increase in typing speed.</p>
    <p><strong>Typing speeds before training</strong>: 60, 62, 58, 65, 63, 59, 61, 60, 64, 62 (words per minute)</p>
    <p><strong>Typing speeds after training</strong>: 67, 66, 65, 70, 69, 63, 68, 66, 71, 67</p>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Formulate Hypotheses</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Null Hypothesis (H₀)</em>: The mean difference in typing speeds before and after training is zero (no improvement).</li>
                <li><em>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)</em>: The mean difference in typing speeds before and after training is greater than zero.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Calculate the Difference Between Each Pair</strong> (typing speed before vs. after for each employee) and find the mean and standard deviation of the differences.</li>
        <li><strong>Run the Paired T-Test</strong> to compute the <em>t-value</em> and <em>p-value</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Interpret the Result</strong>: If the p-value is less than 0.05, we conclude the training program significantly improved typing speed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Summary of Use-Cases:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>One-Sample T-Test</strong>: To check if the mean of a single sample differs from a known value.</li>
        <li><strong>Independent Two-Sample T-Test</strong>: To compare the means of two separate, independent groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Paired T-Test</strong>: To compare means from the same group at two different times or under two different conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each type of t-test helps make statistically sound conclusions based on sample data, highlighting meaningful differences and effects in various contexts.</p>
